  abstract = {The present work is a comparative study of {CoFe/IrMn} exchange biased
	top, bottom, and dual spin valves. For as-deposited top spin valves
	the exchange bias energy Jk was determined to be 0.14 erg/cm2 for
	{IrMn} 50 Ã…. The exchange field (Hex) decreases rapidly upon heating,
	resulting in a blocking temperature (Tb) of 250â€Š{Â°C.} For bottom
	{IrMn} based spin valves the exchange bias energy is much higher
	(Jk=0.28â€Šerg/cm2) while {Î”R/R} (6.9\%) is reduced with respect
	to top spin valves ({\textgreater}8.0\%). This is interpreted as
	showing that Hex is dominantly dependent on fcc(111) crystalline
	texture while {Î”R/R} is sensitive to both crystalline texture and
	interface roughness. Dual spin valves based on the above results
	showed two exchange loops due to the difference in the exchange bias
	energy between the top and bottom pinning layers. Â© 2000 American

  abstract = {A {PbTiO3} thin film prepared on silicon substrate by solâ€�gel technique
	has been studied by {microâ€�Raman} spectroscopy and xâ€�ray diffraction
	{(XRD).} The spectra, in comparison to the single crystal work, show
	high background in the low frequency region and Raman lines are broader,
	thus revealing the polycrystalline nature of the film. The frequencies
	of the Raman bands in the film are clearly shifted to lower frequencies
	compared to the corresponding ones in the single crystal or powder
	forms. This phenomenon is similar to the hydrostatic pressure effect
	on the Raman lines of {PbTiO3} single crystal. The film, therefore,
	has grains under stress. This stress is caused by nonequilibrium
	defects and diffusion at the interface. Measurements at different
	film positions showed variations in the frequency and width of the
	Raman bands which are associated with the stress and grain size inhomogeneities.
	The measured shift in the Raman frequencies suggests grain sizes
	â‰¤1 Î¼m. {XRD} indicates grain size of around 22 nm and an average
	stress around 1.3 {GPa}, which was determined using the measured
	shift for the câ€�lattice constant. {\copyright} 1995 American Institute

	introduce the {TTIP} precursor into the reaction chamber in multiple
	``Î¼pulses'' with orwithout delay times for desorption of surface
	product species, analogous to conventional {ALDpurge} cycles. Larger
	doses led to significantly higher growth rates while maintaining
	excellent uniformity across 100 mm wafers, effects which underscore
	the importance of surface residence times in rather complex surface
	reaction pathways. The production of {H2O/OH} surface species during
	the {TTIP} half-cycle is intrinsic to the reaction, leading to secondary
	reaction mechanisms and believed responsible for the enhanced growth
	rates and accompanying high uniformity.},

  abstract = {The piezoelectric and dielectric constants in different crystal orientations
	of the lead zirconate titanate {(PZT)} have been phenomenologically
	calculated for the compositions near the morphotropic phase boundary
	at room temperature. For a tetragonal {PZT}, the effective piezoelectric
	constant d33 monotonously decreases as the crystal cutting angle
	from the spontaneous polarization direction [001] increases. However,
	for a rhombohedral {PZT}, the effective piezoelectric constant d33[001]//
	along the perovskite [001] direction was found to be much larger
	than those along the spontaneous polarization direction [111]. This
	crystal orientation-related enhancement is emphasized as the composition
	approaches the morphotropic phase boundary. This suggests that by
	adopting the perovskite [001] orientation with a rhombohedral composition
	near the morphotropic phase boundary, the piezoelectric constant
	d33 for {PZT} can be greatly enhanced. {\copyright} 1998 American

	of oxide perovskites have become increasingly important. A single
	terminated surface is a prerequisite for reproducible thin film growth
	and fundamental growth studies. In this work, atomic and lateral
	force microscopy have been used to display different terminations
	of {SrTiO3.} We observe hydroxylation of the topmost {SrO} layer
	after immersion of {SrTiO3} in water, which is used to enhance the
	etch-selectivity of {SrO} relative to {TiO2} in a buffered {HF} solution.
	We reproducibly obtain perfect and single terminated surfaces, irrespective
	of the initial state of polished surfaces and the {pH} value of the
	{HF} solution. This approach to the problem might be used for a variety
	of multi-component oxide single crystals. True two-dimensional reflection
	high-energy electron diffraction intensity oscillations are observed
	during homo epitaxial growth using pulsed laser deposition on these
	surfaces. {\copyright} 1998 American Institute of Physics.},

  abstract = {After a brief summary of the ideas underlying the quantum theory of
	dispersion it is shown that it can be applied to the refraction of
	x-rays, although the assumption that the number of atoms in a wave
	length cube is large is no longer satisfied. A general formula for
	the index of refraction in terms of the atomic absorption coefficient
	a and the critical frequencies is given. From the condition, experimentally
	verified, that the electrons in the atom for impressed frequencies,
	large compared to their natural frequencies, shall act like free
	electrons as far as the index of refraction is concerned, a relation
	is obtained for a. From the failure of this relation when applied
	to the groups of electrons separately, conclusions are drawn as to
	the coupling of the groups. Some considerations on the origin of
	the Compton shifted radiation are added, from which it appears that
	in the wave description this radiation must be regarded as coming
	from all the atoms and as being coherent with the incident waves;
	a result suited to stress the difficulty of harmonizing the wave
	picture with that of quantum processes in the atoms.},

	investigate the initial stages of {TiO2} growth on a Si(001) substrate
	by atomic layer deposition {(ALD).} The core level spectra of Si
	2p, C 1s, O 1s, and Ti 2p were measured at every half reaction in
	the titanium tetra-isopropoxide {(TTIP)--H2O} {ALD} process. The
	ligand exchange reactions were verified using the periodic oscillation
	of the C 1s concentration, as well as changes in the hydroxyl concentration.
	{XPS} analysis revealed that {Ti2O3} and Si oxide were formed at
	the initial stages of {TiO2} growth. A stoichiometric {TiO2} layer
	was dominantly formed after two cycles and was chemically saturated
	after four cycles.},

  abstract = {Among many promising high-k dielectrics, {TiO2} is an interesting
	candidate because of its relatively high k value of over 40 and its
	easy integration into existing semiconductor manufacturing schemes.
	The most critical issues of {TiO2} are its low electrical stability
	and its high leakage current density. However, doping {TiO2} with
	Al has shown to yield significant improvement of layer quality on
	Ru electrodes {[S.} K. Kim et al., Adv. Mater. 20, 1429 (2008)].
	In this work we investigated if atomic layer deposition {(ALD)} of
	Al doped {TiO2} is feasible in a batch system. Electrical characterizations
	were done using common electrode materials like {TiN}, {TaN}, or
	W. Additionally, the effect of plasma enhanced processing in this
	reactor was studied. For this investigation a production batch {ALD}
	furnace has been retrofitted with a plasma source which can be used
	for post deposition anneals with oxygen radicals as well as for directly
	plasma enhanced {ALD.} After evaluation of several Ti precursors
	a deposition process for {AlTiOx} with excellent film thickness and
	composition uniformity was developed. The effects of post deposition
	anneals, {Al2O3} interlayers between electrode and {TiO2}, Al doping
	concentration, plasma enhanced deposition and electrode material
	type on leakage current density are shown. An optimized {AlTiOx}
	deposition process on {TaN} electrodes yields to leakage current
	density of 5â€‰Ã—â€‰10âˆ’7 A/cm2 at 2 V and k values of about 35.
	Thus, it could be demonstrated that a plasma enhanced batch {ALD}
	process for Al doped {TiO2} is feasible with acceptable leakage current
	density on a standard electrode material.},

	the sample has tetragonal symmetry (at = 4.037â€Š{\AA}, ct = 4.138â€Š{\AA}),
	and transforms below âˆ¼250 K into a phase which, unexpectedly, has
	monoclinic symmetry (am = 5.717â€Š{\AA}, bm = 5.703â€Š{\AA}, cm =
	4.143â€Š{\AA}, Î² = 90.53$\,^{\circ}$, at 20 K). The intensity data

  abstract = {Atomic layer deposition {(ALD)}, a chemical vapor deposition technique
	based on sequential self-terminating gas--solid reactions, has for
	about four decades been applied for manufacturing conformal inorganic
	material layers with thickness down to the nanometer range. Despite
	the numerous successful applications of material growth by {ALD},
	many physicochemical processes that control {ALD} growth are not
	yet sufficiently understood. To increase understanding of {ALD} processes,
	overviews are needed not only of the existing {ALD} processes and
	their applications, but also of the knowledge of the surface chemistry
	of specific {ALD} processes. This work aims to start the overviews
	on specific {ALD} processes by reviewing the experimental information
	available on the surface chemistry of the trimethylaluminum/water
	process. This process is generally known as a rather ideal {ALD}
	process, and plenty of information is available on its surface chemistry.
	This in-depth summary of the surface chemistry of one representative
	{ALD} process aims also to provide a view on the current status of
	understanding the surface chemistry of {ALD}, in general. The review
	starts by describing the basic characteristics of {ALD}, discussing
	the history of {ALD---including} the question who made the first
	{ALD} experiments---and giving an overview of the two-reactant {ALD}
	processes investigated to date. Second, the basic concepts related
	to the surface chemistry of {ALD} are described from a generic viewpoint
	applicable to all {ALD} processes based on compound reactants. This
	description includes physicochemical requirements for self-terminating
	reactions, reaction kinetics, typical chemisorption mechanisms, factors
	causing saturation, reasons for growth of less than a monolayer per
	cycle, effect of the temperature and number of cycles on the growth
	per cycle {(GPC)}, and the growth mode. A comparison is made of three
	models available for estimating the sterically allowed value of {GPC}
	in {ALD.} Third, the experimental information on the surface chemistry
	in the trimethylaluminum/water {ALD} process are reviewed using the
	concepts developed in the second part of this review. The results
	are reviewed critically, with an aim to combine the information obtained
	in different types of investigations, such as growth experiments
	on flat substrates and reaction chemistry investigation on high-surface-area
	materials. Although the surface chemistry of the trimethylaluminum/water
	{ALD} process is rather well understood, systematic investigations
	of the reaction kinetics and the growth mode on different substrates
	are still missing. The last part of the review is devoted to discussing
	issues which may hamper surface chemistry investigations of {ALD},
	such as problematic historical assumptions, nonstandard terminology,
	and the effect of experimental conditions on the surface chemistry
	of {ALD.} I hope that this review can help the newcomer get acquainted
	with the exciting and challenging field of surface chemistry of {ALD}
	and can serve as a useful guide for the specialist towards the fifth
	decade of {ALD} research.},

	generally enable deposition of oxides of many metals. With this approach,

	The Pb3+ centers are created by optical illumination and are found
	to be metastable at room temperature. Their decay kinetics follow
	a stretched exponential function which suggests dispersive transport.
	The traps have the same character as the upper valence band which
	is formed from the hybridization of Pb s and O p states.},
